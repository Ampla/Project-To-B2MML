Project-To-B2MML
================

Xml Stylesheet to convert a AmplaProject export to an Equipment B2MML

History
-------

I was demonstrating the Ampla's Master Data feature and someone configured the source file to be another AmplaProject.xml.

While this was not part of the demo, I thought what a great idea to detect changes between two projects.

To use
------

1. Add a File2AmplaSynchronization to System Configuration.Master Data
2. Set the MasterDataB2MMLFile property to the AmplaProject.xml
3. Set the HostB2MMLStyleSheetUri to the Ampla_to_Equipment_B2MML.xslt
